## About Me

Hello! My name is **Lix Nerdieu** (not my real name), also known as **Lixvah**, a 26-year-old software developer with a deep passion for creating efficient, simple, and engaging games.

With over 10 years of experience (including education) in **Java** and **Web Development**, and my most recent work in **Game Development**

I am not a good or fast learner like most people, but I have my own way of learning. I learned by skipping the basics and playing with large projects from the beginning. It was tough at first, but I got through it and caught up with others.

I am a perfectionist and like to work independently. Even though the work I do is not big or show off to anyone, for me it is all I need.

## Project History
